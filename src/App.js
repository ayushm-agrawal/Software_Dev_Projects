This estimate, based on estimates from USDAâ€™s Economic Research Service of <strong>31 percent</strong> food loss at the retail and consumer levels, corresponded to approximately <strong>133 billion pounds and $161 billion</strong> worth of food in 2010. This amount of waste has far-reaching impacts on food security, resource conservation and climate change</p>
